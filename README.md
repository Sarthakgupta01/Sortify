# Sortify

A dynamic and interactive web-based tool designed to visualize popular sorting algorithms. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project provides an engaging way to understand sorting techniques through animations, sound effects, and user-controlled customization.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays real-time animations with color-coded bars to demonstrate sorting progress.
- **Beep Sound Feedback**: Adds an auditory cue during the sorting process to enhance the learning experience.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Custom Controls**:
  - Adjustable sliders to control the size of the array and the speed of the sorting visualization.
  - Buttons to start, pause, or reset the sorting process.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across all screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structural layout of the visualizer.
- **CSS3/SCSS**: For styling, responsiveness, and maintaining reusable styles.
- **JavaScript**: For algorithm implementation, animations, and user interactivity.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the sliders to adjust the array size and speed. Select an algorithm and click "Visualize" to start the sorting process.
